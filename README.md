# MySQL

The goal of this project was to create my own database that utilized the BTree data structures that I made in my CS 8 class at Pasadena City College. The functionality of the database includes a subset of common commands used in SQL:

  - insert
  - select
  - create
  - print
  - load
  - store
  - drop
  
 Special thanks to Professor Sassan Barkeshli who pushed me beyond my limits and taught me how to teach myself.
